        <h1>Responsive Redesign CS1300 Assignment</h1>
        <p> I chose to redesign the Narragansett Indian Nation's Website for my project. I chose this specific website because it involves a part of the local Rhode Island community. From my observations, it was probably built by someone who had the information they wanted to convey but didnâ€™t know how to present it in an effective way for users to understand/navigate. I will be showing my Design Process and what the end result ended up looking like</p>

    <div id="Problems with Website" class="section">
        <h1> Problems </h1>
        <h2 class="subunit"> Accessibilty Issues</h2>
        <ul>
            <p>The navigation bar is too big</p>
            <ul>
                <p>The Icon of the tribe flag is not as noticeable as it could be (considering they are a nation and should have their flag seen)</p>
                <p>Pictures cannot be seen clearly</p>
                <p>It is hard to find the rest of the content on the page</p>
                <p>The navigation bar seems to have a lot of content</p>
            </ul>
            <p>All the bright colors can make things seem cluttered and can cause contrast issues</p>
        </ul>

    <div id="Visual Redesign" class="section">
      <h1>Visual Redesign</h1>
      <div class = "subunit">
        <h2>Sketch</h2>
        <p> The first image on the left contains the nine sketches I drew to brainstorm different interfaces. The image on the right was final sketch that I chose to move forward with. </p>
        <div class="pictures">
          <img class="image" alt="nine sketches" src="./photos/nine_sketches.png" >
          <img class="image" alt="final sketch" src="./photos/FinalSketch.png" >

      <div class = "subunit">
        <h2>Low-Fidelity</h2>
        <p>These are the Wire-Frames that I did for the Interface. The images go from left to right: desktop, tablet, and mobile. I wanted to make sure that this design would be easy for people to navigate. That is why I had few items in the menu that had the abilty to drop down. Also, at the bottom I allowed for more links and pages to be added for other information. </p>
        <div class="pictures">
            <img class="image" alt="desktop wireframe" src="./photos/wireframeDesktop.png" >

        </div>
      </div>

      <div class = "subunit">
        <h2>Style Guide</h2>
        <p>My next step was creating a style guide of colors and fonts for the whole website. I wanted to make sure that I was using colors that were not going to raise contrast issues. I also attempmted to find fonts that people could easily read. </p>
        <div class="pictures">
            <img class="image" alt="text and icon style guide" src="./photos/styleguide.png">
